Project Title : Health Harmony

Description

It's a health and fitness website designed to help you achieve your exercise goals from the comfort of your home.

Health Harmony offers a comprehensive range of features, including workout plans, a diet plan tailored to help you achieve your desired physique, and much more. I built this site using ASP.NET MVC, utilizing the code-first approach with Entity Framework, and LINQ to SQL for user authentication on the login and signup pages. The front end is crafted with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap to ensure a seamless and user-friendly experience.

I am proud of the dedication and effort that went into creating Health Harmony, and I hope it can make a positive impact on your fitness journey.

Check it out and start your path to a healthier you! ðŸ’ªâœ¨
