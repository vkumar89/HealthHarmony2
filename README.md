Description

Health Harmony is a health and fitness website designed to help you achieve your exercise goals from the comfort of your home. It offers a comprehensive range of features, including workout plans, a diet plan tailored to help you achieve your desired physique, and much more.

This site is built using ASP.NET MVC, utilizing the code-first approach with Entity Framework, and LINQ to SQL for user authentication on the login and signup pages. The front end is crafted with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap to ensure a seamless and user-friendly experience.
